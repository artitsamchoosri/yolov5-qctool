==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on June 17, 2022 at 2:48 PM GMT

It includes 591 images.
Fang31 are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 1024x1024 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 10 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
